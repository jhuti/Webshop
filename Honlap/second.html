  <h2>Single flowers</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 6%">Most double flowers are of little use, as they're too elaborate. 
Some are bred without male and female parts, while others have so many petals 
that bees can't get to the nectar and pollen. 
So, single dahlias and other single blooms are popular 
with many bees, while doubles are usually ignored.</p>

<h2>Purple flowers</h2> 
<p style="text-indent: 6%">Bees can see the purple more clearly than any other colour, 
so grow lots of purple plants, such as lavender, alliums, buddleja and catmint. 
That said, flowers of other colours will still attract bees, so don't go pulling them all up! 
You can prolong the flowering of many plants by deadheading them.</p>

<h2>Tubular-shaped flowers</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 6%">Tubular-shaped flowers such as foxgloves, honeysuckle, 
penstemons and snapdragons are the favourite 
feeding places of long-tongued bees such as the garden bumblebee, Bombus hortorum.</p>

<h2>Flowers for all seasons</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 6%">It's vital you provide flowers throughout the year. Bees are most active from March to September, 
but overwintering queens and workers may emerge on warm days in winter, too. 
It's also a good idea to have at least two nectar- 
or pollen-rich plants in flower at any one time during this period. The nectar feeds the adult bee, 
while the pollen is collected to feed the young. You can never have too many!</p>
